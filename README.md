# Smart Corp Cheque Application

For time consuming, I choose use .net framework + angular to build my application.Â  
at backend, I use MVC + WebApi to create a webapi controller to create cheque. create a service to handle all business logic and create unit tests on these serviceat Frontend, I choose Angular is because easy to mockup style, not too much difference to use React but I familiar to use bootstrap and angular material to build form style and date picker control.

## Backend
The backend service is build by .net framework web application
Build the project in ChequeApplication folder and run as http://localhost:4300

## Frontend
The frontend project is generated with [Angular CLI] version 8.3.4
run npm install in Angular folder to downlaod node_modules

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
